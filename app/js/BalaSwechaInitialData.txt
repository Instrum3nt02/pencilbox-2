Can a weak acid solution have the same pH as a strong acid solution?","manuals":[{"title":"Acid Base Investigation","src":{"command":"doc-reader","args":["/var/www/manuals/acid-base-investigation.docx"]}}]}]},{"name":"Carbon & it's Compunds","slug":"carbon-and-its-compunds","contents":[]},{"name":"Chemical Bonding","slug":"chemical-bonding","contents":[]},{"name":"Structure of Atom","slug":"structure-of-atom","contents":[{"name":"Models of the Hydrogen Atom","slug":"models-of-hydrogen-atom","type":"apps","exec":{"command":"hydrogen-atom","args":[]},"subject":"chemistry","keywords":["",""],"description":"How did scientists figure out the structure of atoms without looking at them?
